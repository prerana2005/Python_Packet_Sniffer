# Python_Packet_Sniffer
A Python Packet Sniffer captures network packets using raw sockets, allowing analysis of protocols like IP, TCP, and UDP. It mimics tools like Wireshark/tcpdump in a simpler form. With client-server communication, it can send captured data remotely, useful for basic network monitoring and analysis.
